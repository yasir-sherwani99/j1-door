                                A common reason for your garage door not working is a broken
                                spring and you can usually diagnose this fairly easily.
                                Springs are typically directly above the garage door near
                                the wall that provides tension to help your garage door
                                opener lift the garage door. It’s important to note that if
                                you have two springs on your garage door, you’ll most likely
                                need to have both springs replaced.
