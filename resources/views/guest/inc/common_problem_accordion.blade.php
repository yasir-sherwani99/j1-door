                                    A common reason for a garage door not closing can be a malfunctioning
                                    photo-eye. Photo eyes are there to keep the garage door from closing if
                                    an object passes through the infrared beams. Photo-eyes need to be lined
                                    up correctly, if the alignment is thrown off it may cause your garage
                                    door to not close. Also, if the lens on one or both of the photo eyes is
                                    dirty with debris, this can also cause your garage door to not operate.
                                    With both of these scenarios, your photo-eyes system assumes that there
                                    is an obstruction in the door. If your photo eye is flashing that means
                                    an obstruction is in the path of the door. Remove the debris and adjust
                                    the photo-eye until the indicator light is no longer flashing. Your door
                                    should now properly operate.

                                    Another common reason for your garage door not working is a broken
                                    spring. A spring provides tension to help your garage door opener lift
                                    your garage door. This is an issue you can usually diagnose fairly
                                    easily. Springs are typically directly above the garage door near the
                                    wall. It’s important to note that if you have two springs on your garage
                                    door, you’ll most likely need to have both springs replaced.​

                                    If you’ve discovered that there’s no issue with your photo-eyes or
                                    garage door spring, another thing to check is your remote control to
                                    your garage door opener. If you find that it’s only one garage door
                                    remote that doesn’t work correctly, your remote may just need a new
                                    battery. If you replace the battery in the remote and it still doesn’t
                                    work, give a reputable garage door company a call to diagnose the
                                    problem. A new garage door opener is typically not needed, unless yours
                                    is more than 10 years old.​

                                    your garage door is noisy. This issue can sometimes be fixed with a
                                    manufacturer recommended lubricant. Hinges, rollers and springs should
                                    be lubricated regularly to keep these parts running smoothly for many
